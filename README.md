# Andarael_Resahde_Sahders

## Description

This repo contains shaders for [Reshade](https://reshade.me/) that I have created or modified.

## Installation

Place the shaders and textures files in your `reshade-shaders/Shaders` and `reshade-shaders/Textures` folders respectively.

## Shaders

### [CAS with Depth](shaders/CAS_depth.fx)

This is a modified version of the Contrast Adaptive Sharpening shader that reduces the effect with the distance.
This is useful when you want to sharpen the image but don't want to sharpen the background.
